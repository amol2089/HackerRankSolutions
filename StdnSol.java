 * Input Format

There are three lines of input:

The first line contains an integer.
The second line contains a double.
The third line contains a String.
Output Format

There are three lines of output:

On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.
To make the problem easier, a portion of the code is already provided in the editor.
